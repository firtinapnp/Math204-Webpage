        <h5>Textbook</h5>
        <img class="left-align" src="images/book.jpg" alt="">
        <p>W. E. Boyce and R. C. DiPrima, Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems, 10th Edition (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2012).</p>
        <h5>Topics to be covered (tentative)</h5>
        <p>From B & D Chapter/Section numbers the topics to be covered are 1.1-1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 3.1-3.6, 4.1-4.4 (partial), 5.1-5.3, 6.1-6.4, 6.6, 7.1-7.3(partial), 7.4-7.9, 10.1- 10.4.</p>
        <h5>Homework</h5>
        <p>Problems will be assigned weekly related to the material covered in lectures</p>
        <h5>Evaluation method</h5>
        <p>Students’ progress will be evaluated according to their performance in the quizzes, two midterms and a final exam. There will be five quizzes and two midterm (MT) exams. The pop quizzes will be given during the PSs. The MT Exams 1 and 2 are planned to be held around the weeks of 5th and 10th weeks of the semester, respectively. Quiz problems will be selected from a list of suggested HW exercises posted on the course website prior to quizzes. The MT exams will cover the material not covered in the earlier exams. The final exam will be a comprehensive exam covering all the material of the course. The contribution of the quizzes, midterm and final exams are as follows: Quizzes 2% each, midterm exams 25% each, final exam 40%. Exams will be given out of 105 points, so in principle a maximum score of 104.5 is possible for this class.</p>
        <h5>Attendance</h5>
        <p>Students are required to attend all the lectures and PSs. Pop quizzes will be administered during the PSs.</p>
        <h5>Passing Grade</h5>
        <p>At least 40 out of 100.</p>
        <h5>Grade Categories</h5>
        <p>This is a tentative list and might be shifted down as seen appropriate by the instructors. [104.5, A+, 100, A, 94, A-, 88, B+, 82, B, 76, B-, 70, C+, 64, C, 58, C-, 52, D+, 46, D, 40, F, 0] (lower bound inclusive and upper bound exclusive for each grade, except A+ and F for which both bounds are inclusive).</p>
        <h5>Make-up Policy</h5>
        <p>There is no make-up for exams in general; but in case of documented valid excuses (e.g., cases of illness, family emergencies, or attendance to university endorsed activities), a comprehensive make-up will be administered after the final for a missed midterm or final. Note that even if you miss a midterm, you will have to take the comprehensive make-up given after the final. If you miss more than one exam, the grade you receive from the make-up will count for all missed exams. If you miss a quiz with such a valid excuse, you are also entitled to take a make-up for the quiz you missed.</p>
        <h5>Policy for Auditing Students</h5>
        <p>In order to get an AU in this course a student should attend a minimum of 20 lectures. To determine this, the auditing student(s) should contact the instructor at the end of each class and ask to sign a special attendance sheet.</p>
        <h5>Academic Dishonesty</h5>
        <p>Students and faculty adhere to the following principles of academic honesty at Koç University. Cheating, plagiarism, and collusion are serious offenses resulting in an F as well as serious disciplinary action.</p>
